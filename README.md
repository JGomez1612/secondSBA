## Objectives

- Employ basic JavaScript syntax accurately.
- Implement control flow structures such as conditionals and loops effectively.
- Use arrays and objects to organize and manage data.
- Develop functions to create reusable code.
- Utilize loops and iteration to navigate through data collections.
- Implement error handling to manage potential code failures gracefully.

## Rubric Checklist
- Declare variables properly using `let` and `const` where appropriate.✔
- Use operators to perform calculations on variable and literals✔
- Use string, numbers, boolean values cached within variables✔
- Use at least 2 if/else statements to control program flow. Optionally, use at least 1 switch statement✔
- Use try/catch statements to manage potential errors in the code, such as incorrectly formatted or typed data being fed into your program.✔
- Utilize at least two different types of loops.✔
- Utilize at least one loop control keyword such as break or continue.✔
- Create and/or manipulate arrays and objects.✔
- Demonstrate the retrieval, manipulation, and removal of items in an array or properties in an object.✔
- Use functions to handle repeated tasks.✔
- Program outputs processed data as described above. Partial credit will be earned depending on the level of adherence to the described behavior.✔
- Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).✔
- Commit frequently to the git repository.✔
- Include a README file that contains a description of your application. ✔

## Desired Output
Within an array should be these objects
    {
      id: 125, // ID of learner
      avg: 0.985, // (47 + 150) / (50 + 150)
      1: 0.94, // 47 / 50
      2: 1.0 // 150 / 150
    },
    {
      id: 132,
      avg: 0.82, // (39 + 125) / (50 + 150)
      1: 0.78, // 39 / 50
      2: 0.833 // late: (140 - 15) / 150
    }
